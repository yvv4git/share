The Negative Impact Goldfish Have on Freshwater Life,"Flushing fish to freedom is a common cartoon theme, but has become a growing global problem for rivers or lakes. In 2003’s Finding Nemo, a Moorish idol trapped in an aquarium yearningly tells Nemo that, “all drains lead to the ocean.” The movie prompted viewers to flush their fish, or set them free in bodies of water.

Goldfish in particular are an invasive species that are thriving in freshwater, but causing ecological damage and endangering native species. In the Niagara River, officials pulled out a 14-inch goldfish. In Minnesota, the city of Burnsville displayed an 18-inch goldfish found in Keller Lake, and wildlife officials in Carver County caught as many as 50,000 pounds of goldfish living in multiple lakes.

Wildlife conservationists are trying to stop goldfish from taking over rivers and lakes. However, the lack of research as to how goldfish live in the wild is a major challenge for this task. Up until the last decade, there have been few studies on how goldfish migrate and spawn in the wild. Wildlife officials need this data to stop goldfish from taking over and causing permanent damage.
Ornamental to Invasive

Goldfish (Carassius auratus) are a domesticated fish that originated in Asia. The popular freshwater fish was exported to the U.S. colonies in the early 1700s and settlers intentionally released them into ponds. By the 1800s, the goldfish was considered an ornamental species, and the U.S. Fish Commission provided states with goldfish for aquariums, fountains and decorative ponds.

Goldfish have now been observed in freshwater rivers, ponds or lakes in every U.S. state, except Alaska. Although people have been dumping goldfish into the wild for centuries, the problem has intensified in the last 40 years.

Commercial fishing boats in the Michigan waters of Lake Erie, for example, didn’t harvest any goldfish in 1980. By 1997, they pulled in almost 11,000 pounds of goldfish. The poundage fluctuated since then from zero in 2003 to almost 91,000 pounds in 2009. In total, almost one million pounds of goldfish were fished from these waters by 2019.

Goldfish aren’t just invading U.S. waterways. The goldfish population in Australian rivers has increased by 63 percent since the 1970s and could cause similar damage.
Destructing Habitats

Goldfish are omnivores with a distinct feeding style. Whereas herbivores snack on plants, limnivores munch on mud and carnivores eat other fish, omnivores will take what they can get. For goldfish, that means sifting along the bottom of its habitat to see what looks good.

In trawling a lake floor or riverbed, goldfish disrupt the sediment that has settled and compacted overtime. Among this sediment are nutrients, including phosphorus, which have been contained and rendered inactive. Once disturbed, the phosphorus re-enters the water column and changes the chemistry. Algae grows when phosphorus levels become too high, and can lead to algae blooms, which are harmful to both humans and animals.

Disrupting the sediment can also cause the water to become murkier, which means sunlight isn’t able to penetrate like before. The loss of sunlight can kill underwater plants and disrupt both the habitat and food source for native species.

In addition to polluting waters, goldfish are also carriers of parasites and diseases. Goldfish are prone to fish lice, for example, which can cause mortality in other fish populations. Studies have also found that goldfish are a common carrier of parasites that affect the gills. While goldfish may be hearty enough to tolerate the parasites, ecologists worry about vulnerable native species.

Many locales are now taking action to rid their waterways of goldfish.
Flushing Isn't Freedom

Not all invasive species are a problem, and an estimated 90 percent of non-native species don’t have a huge impact on the environments they invade. Goldfish are an exception, which is why some local officials say they must be flushed from waterways.

Only in the past decade have scientists begun tracking and studying goldfish to learn how they live in the wild. One team of Australian researchers focused on goldfish living in a river to understand how far they typically travel and where they prefer to spawn. The researchers caught 21 wild goldfish and anesthetized them so they could be weighed, measured, tagged and released back into the water.

The study found goldfish don’t move far, and they typically travel about 0.18 miles each day. Goldfish thrive in slow moving or still water, and they head to inlets or coves for spawning.

Such studies are informing wildlife officials and private exterminators who remove goldfish from waterways. Exterminators head to inlets where goldfish are most likely to swim, and use techniques like electrofishing to stun the fish below and scoop out non-native species. Non-targeted fish wake up within moments and continue swimming.

Environmental scientists used electrofishing in 2020 to weed out goldfish from the Cornelia Lake system in Minnesota where they estimated more than 20,000 goldfish now dominate.

Wildlife officials urge goldfish owners to not flush their fish or release them into bodies of water. They don’t consider it setting the fish “free.” Rather, it might mean exterminators might stun little Nemo. "
The Difference Between Dieting and Lasting Lifestyle Changes,"Over the past few months, I’ve watched my husband change his eating habits and steadily lose weight, including those pandemic pounds. He’s cut back on his beloved sweet tea, passing up chocolate, and eating fish without drowning it in tartar sauce. He’s notching his belt, and buying clothes in a smaller size.

This all came as a surprise to me, given his long-term struggle with weight gain and high blood pressure. He had a pattern of crash dieting every two years before his physical came due, only to gain back every pound and then some. I worried about him, but I’d pretty much given up. And then, our primary care physician casually mentioned a lifestyle program the practice offered, and my husband agreed to try it. It entails weekly visits, and a modest weight loss of six pound in six months. My husband’s done that and more.

He's not alone in facing the reality that diets often don’t work. Changing lifestyle can be much more effective — if you manage to stick with it. That journey takes honesty, goal setting and vigilance. And if you want to go that route, here’s what to consider as you decide what works best for you:
1. Set Your Goals

Before committing to a lifestyle change, set long-term goals, says Michelle Edacheril-Moore, a family nurse practitioner at BJC Health Care in O’Fallon, Missouri. Be honest with yourself. Decide whether you want to eat healthier meals, exercise more, lose weight quickly or reduce weight and keep it off for the long run. Usually losing weight fast and keeping it off are not accomplished at the same time, says Edacheril-Moore.

Then commit to your goals. “We all have things that we want to do, but sometimes we’re not willing to put in the work to achieve all that we want,” Edarcheril-Moore adds. Finding your internal motivation can hinge on knowing that you’re making changes because you can see the health benefits, says Elisabetta Politi, a dietician at the Duke Lifestyle and Health Management Center in Durham, North Carolina.
2. Plan Your Meals

Take time to plan your meals, which is different than meal prepping. With meal planning, you can adjust for your nutritional goals and also make room for what’s going on in your daily life, says Edacheril-Moore. You’ll waste less food, and you won’t end up feeling that you’ve missed any goals because life happens, says Edacheril-Moore.

To avoid feeling hungry in between meals, snack on some protein. Nibble a piece of low-fat string cheese, or sip a protein shake. During meals, eat a bite of protein first, and then a bite of carbs.

Wondering what to stock in your pantry? Choose foods that you don’t find boring. And remember this basic rule of thumb from Edacheril-Moore: “Food that goes bad is probably good for you. Food that stays good is probably bad for you.” 
3. Eat Mindfully

There’s a right way to eat according to nutritionists. If you want to get the most out of your meal, take some time to slowly consume your food. Mindful eating can make you more aware of what and how much you are eating, and can enhance the social aspect of eating, by enjoying a meal with others. Pay attention to those times when you overeat. For some, overeating is more common while reading, or scrolling on an electronic device. Find and stick with habits that help you achieve mindful eating.
4. Be Accountable

When I asked my husband what made him so determined to stick with this lifestyle change, he said it was the accountability via weekly meetings with Edacheril-Moore. You can find that support with friends and family, or with a lifestyle program in your community or a local university.

Inversely, lack of support can push you back into old habits. “I have seen where the lack of support, whether it’s friends and/or family, has caused people to return to previous habits. Who you surround yourself with really does make a significant impact on your actions and thought processes,” says Edacheril-Moore.

Remember, too, that we all slip up. Give yourself grace. If you’re trying to turn around choices you’ve made for decades, it will take time for you to start feeling like you’ve established new routines. “Understand that changing your lifestyle means that you are changing your style of life. This is no simple task,” she says.
5. Stay Vigilant

Losing weight and committing to healthy choices, or an exercise routine, is a tough battle, says Politi. Even though we know more about nutrition and fitness than, say, 40 years ago, our environment can work against weight loss. We rely on cars, and we’re probably not as active as our parents or grandparents used to be.

Internal motivation matters, she adds. Take a problem-solving approach to lifestyle change. Monitor your stress. Take note if your exercise habits start to drop off, or overeating kicks back in. Think of excess weight as a relapsing condition, like controlling your blood pressure. Life gets complicated. We lose jobs, people we love get sick or die, and the weight comes back on, says Politi.

As for my husband, he’s energetic and staying motivated. The more he sees the benefits, the harder he digs into the commitment. Not every day brings success. He stresses over things. Some days I watch him head to the pantry and just walk back out. Most days, he’d much rather polish off anything than head out for a walk. Every stage of life provides a different challenge. “It’s not lack of willpower, it’s just hard,” says Politi."

The Easy Way to Roll Your Dough Into the Shape You Actually Need,"If only pie recipes asked you to roll the dough into an amoeba shape. I’m excellent at that one. But perfect circles or rectangles of dough? That takes a few reps.

Pies, cut-out cookies, cinnamon rolls, and danishes require a dough that is rolled out into a specific shape. If you decide to take the I’ll-fix-it-later approach (roll it out wonky, use a knife to cut the shape out later), you end up with a heap of unnecessary waste. So shape it before you roll.

It doesn’t seem like this would make a difference, but it does. I spent years getting miffed every time I rolled out a Pac-Man-shaped double crust. It wasn’t until I went to pastry school that I learned dough will always roll out into the same shape it starts in. (I just saved you a bundle on tuition, you’re welcome.) If you start with a circle, you’ll end up with a flat circle. If you start with a jagged clump, you’ll get a flat, jagged clump. The reason I kept ending up with half-moons when making a double crust recipe is because the wording in many recipes advise chilling your dough in that shape. The instructions tell us to work the dough into a ball and “split the dough,” “divide the dough,” or “cut the dough in half.” Seems straightforward–cut the sphere of dough in half. Many folks will wrap, chill, and then try to roll out this shape as is. It’s a bad start to making a circular pie crust. It’s great way to get a Pac-Man shape though.

To get the geometric shape you need, try to create a uniform mixture in the shape you want before you get rolling. For pie crust, divide the crumbly mixture before you compact it. Work the dough as separate crust portions, then wrap them as individual discs before they rest. For laminated or yeast dough, shape it before you set it aside to chill, or after the first proof just before you roll it. For any rectangular shapes that rest in the fridge, use the wrap to help encourage the formation of sharp corners. When making cut out cookies, shape the dough by kneading it briefly in your palms to discourage dry, crumbly edges. Then, press the dough on your work surface to create the perfect shape before you hit it with the pin.

Use this shaping technique to your advantage and experiment with baking new shapes. Pies are delicious as rounds, but what a limitation! Have you tried making a rectangular pie in your loaf tin? Or a chicken pot pie for 12 people in a 13x9-inch casserole dish? Maybe your Christmas cookie stamps are triangular trees. If so, you can roll out a giant triangle to optimize dough usage. Don’t worry, when it’s time to make a giant amoeba sugar cookie you can still fall back on old habits."
How to Get Woodpeckers to Fuck Off,"Even if you’re not the most avid birdwatcher, you could probably identify a woodpecker—especially if you saw one on or in a tree. If nothing else, you’d recognize their pointy, drill-like beak that they use to make holes of varying sizes in order to find insects to eat, or create a hole big enough to live in.

But aside from being annoying to listen to, all that pecking can do some damage. Here’s what woodpeckers are capable of, and how to (humanely) encourage them to move along to a different area.
What are woodpeckers pecking, and why?

It would be one thing is woodpeckers stuck to pecking trees, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. They can also peck your home, garage, shed, and other structures. This isn’t ideal, because these holes in your home can let in termites, rodents, and other pets, and lead to various types of structural damage.   And sure, they gravitate towards wood, but woodpeckers have also been known to peck gutters, siding, and air conditions. Why peck metal and other non-wood materials? Because woodpeckers also make noise to attract a mate.

But as irritating and destructive as woodpeckers can be, they’re still an important part of your local ecosystem. In other words, you don’t want to do away with them, but you would appreciate if they took their pecking talents elsewhere.
How to get a woodpecker to relocate

Here are a few ways to keep woodpeckers away from your home, without harming them.
Spruce the place up a bit

Woodpeckers love wood that’s rotting, damaged, and/or full of insects, so do what you can to make sure there’s nothing on your home or property that would attract them. This could include replacing any rotting wood on the exterior of your home, filling in holes, and removing any dead and rotting trees or logs on your property.
Scare them away with loud noises

Woodpeckers get startled when they hear loud noises, so if you see one pecking at your house, it can help to go out side (or open a window) and clap or bang on pots or pans to scare it away. They also aren’t fans of wind chimes, so you may want to hang those in areas where you’ve seen woodpeckers in the past."
How to Get Rid of Powdery Mildew on Your Plants,"One of the best parts about having a garden in the summer is watching your plants grow throughout the season. But if you’re out gazing at your garden one day and notice some white circular spots on the leaves, or that they look like they’ve been dusted with flour, you may be dealing with powdery mildew.

Powdery mildew really isn’t something you want to mess with, because not only can it harm the plant its on, but it can spread to others in your garden and infect them too. Here’s what to know about powdery mildew and how to get rid of it.
What is powdery mildew?

Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that makes it look like plants have been dusted with flour or baby powder. The white powder starts out in circular spots, then eventually spreads to cover the entire leaf—sometimes, including the bottom part of the leaf. The powdery mildew can cause the leaves and buds to become disfigured, twist, break, or turn yellow and dry out.   How to prevent the spread of powdery mildew

The key to getting rid of powdery mildew is to do it as soon as you see it. Unfortunately, once the fungus takes hold of a plant and makes itself at home in its leaves, there’s not much you can do to save that plant. That being said, you can (and should) do what you can to prevent it from spreading to other plants in your garden.

According to the Farmers’ Almanac, the way to do that is by removing all the infected leaves, stems, and fruits from a plant and then either throwing them away in the garbage, or burning them. Don’t just throw the clippings in the woods or on a compost pile, because that can allow the fungus to continue to spread. And then once you’re finished pruning, take the time to sterilize your shears with rubbing alcohol so you don’t infect any other plants.
How to get rid of powdery mildew

As we mentioned, the most important part is catching powdery mildew early on, so you have the best chance of getting rid of it. Here are a few methods, courtesy of the Farmers’ Almanac:
Spray the plants with water

The mildew spores can’t tolerate rain or water because they’re not able to germinate or grow if the leaves of a plant are wet. So spraying your plants with water at least once a week (which you may be doing anyway), can help keep powdery mildew at bay.
DIY sprays

Many seasoned gardeners have their favorite DIY concoctions for getting rid of powdery mildew. Because several contain ingredients like vinegar and baking soda that can burn your plants, test the sprays in a small area first before covering your whole garden with it. A few include:

    1 tablespoon baking soda + 1 tablespoon vegetable oil + 1 teaspoon dish soap + 1 gallon of water
    4 tablespoons baking soda + 2 tablespoons of Murphy’s oil soap + 1 gallon of water
    2 to 3 tablespoons vinegar + 1 gallon of water
    1 part milk to 10 parts water
    1 cup mouthwash + 3 cups of water "
